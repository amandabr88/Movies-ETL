# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this challenge is to help Britta to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. To achieve the result, the code has been refactored to create one function that takes in the three filesâ€”Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
